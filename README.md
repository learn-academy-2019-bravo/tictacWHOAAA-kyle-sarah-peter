# React Tic Tac Toe

## React Best Practices

Here are some rules to keep handy as you build Tic Tac Toe - following them will help you avoid lots of problems.

- Never update State directly, always use setState()
- Never alter the DOM directly, always operate on a value in state
- Only call setState once per method or render cycle
- State is for values that change, Props is for values to pass to a child component, constants should be set outside the component

## Tic Tac Toe Stories

- As a user, I should start off seeing a 3x3 grid on the main page

- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to mark it. My partner should be able to
click on a square after me and see their mark.

- As a user, when someone has won the game (3 squares in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
or there are no more squares, an alert will tell me who has won or that there are no more squares
and the game has ended.


## Extra Challenges
- Use flexbox to set up your grid
- Allow users to choose their mark (X, O, a color, an emoji, etc...)
- Create a component for alerts and push the win/lose messages there instead of using an alert

## Review

In this review I'll be summarizing:

-The team I was on that accomplished this project
-Where I completed the project
-The use of state and props to make this a successful project

My team was composed of Sarah, Peter and myself (Sarah and Peter are my classmates at Learn Academy).  This is the first time we've worked 
together and we made an awesome team!

Learn Academy full-stack developer bootcamp (May 7th)

In order to make this application in React successful, our group had to utilize state and props. (explain mastery of state and props)

Wrap-up:
-This was my team
-Worked on at bootcamp
-Used experience with state and props
